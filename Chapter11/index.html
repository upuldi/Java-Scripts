    <P> <b>coercion</b> and boolean exsistence... </P> 
    
    <p> Booleans behave strangly than Number as if some value is there in a variable and during the time of the coercion it will become true unless the value is 0. This is very useful in AJAX or calls to see whether something is there in a variable after some process.</p>
    
    <p> || operator returns the first value of the comparison if the values are unmatching..</p>
